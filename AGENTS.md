# Agent Execution Contract

This is the repository constitution for automated contributors working on
`abbu`. It supplements machine-wide policy and applies to the entire repository.

## Read Before Changing Behavior

Read this file, the applicable skill under `.skills/`, `README.md`,
`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the relevant implementation before changing public
behavior. For archive semantics, also read `docs/ABBU.md` and inspect the
evidence that supports the behavior.

## Apple Contacts Evidence Boundary

Never infer Apple Contacts storage semantics merely from Core Data table or
column names. Require observed fixture evidence, Apple documentation where
available, or reproducible verification, and record consequential discoveries
in `docs/ABBU.md`.

- Treat table names, column names, entity numbers, relationships, UUID shapes,
  directory names, and file extensions as observations until verified.
- Preserve macOS and Contacts-version variance. Do not turn one fixture's shape
  into an unconditional format guarantee.
- Keep synthetic fixtures deterministic and identify the evidence represented by
  each schema variation.
- Treat contact archives and real address-book exports as sensitive. Do not
  commit personal contacts, photos, account identifiers, or unsanitized bundles.

## Product And Architecture

- Support Ruby 3.3 and newer through `.mise.toml`, the gemspec, and CI.
- Keep the gem framework-independent and free of Rails-only runtime code.
- Preserve `Abbu.open(path)` as the archive entry point, `Abbu::Contact` as the
  normalized contact model, and explicit parser/exporter boundaries.
- Keep parsers responsible for translating supported SQLite or plist evidence
  into `Abbu::Contact` instances. Keep exporters responsible for serializing
  contacts, and keep `Abbu::Archive` responsible for bundle discovery and
  parser selection.
- Keep SQLite and plist parsing distinct when their evidence differs. Share only
  normalized behavior whose semantics are demonstrated across both formats.
- Keep runtime dependencies minimal and justify additions with a concrete public
  requirement.
- Treat documented contact fields, normalized hashes, exporter output, CLI
  behavior, and error behavior as public API governed by SemVer.

## Lossless Parsing And Serialization Boundaries

Normalization is a presentation/convenience layer, not permission to discard
source evidence or rewrite interchange semantics.

- Preserve the exact observed source value whenever ABBU also exposes a
  normalized value. Use explicit evidence fields such as `raw_label` rather
  than overwriting the source representation.
- Parser normalization must be non-destructive: callers must be able to inspect
  both the normalized semantic value and the original stored value when the
  source supplied one.
- Do not let display-oriented normalization leak into lossless or interchange
  exporters. vCard and any future ABBU writer/round-trip path must prefer the
  original source representation when that representation can affect Apple
  import or round-trip behavior.
- Treat changes to regexes, matchers, label recognition, date classification,
  identifier parsing, path/UUID interpretation, and parser dispatch as
  compatibility-sensitive. Review both what newly matches and what stops
  matching.
- Whenever a matcher or normalization rule changes, add boundary regression
  cases for: a known Apple value, a custom value, a malformed near-match, an
  already-normalized value, and Unicode where applicable.
- Whenever parsed data can later be serialized, add a round-trip-oriented
  regression proving source-significant values survive parse → model → export.
- Never replace an observed Apple token with a friendlier spelling in an
  interchange format solely because the friendly value is preferable for human
  display. Require evidence that the target consumer treats the forms
  equivalently.
- If source fidelity and human-friendly output need different representations,
  keep both and make the exporter choose deliberately for its target format.

## Canonical Workflows

Project-local commands are authoritative:

- `bin/spec [arguments]` runs RSpec;
- `bin/lint [arguments]` runs RuboCop;
- `bin/package` builds and verifies the gem package; and
- `bin/dev` runs the Guard development loop.

CI must call these commands instead of recreating their implementation. Add a
new canonical workflow under `bin/` before teaching CI a separate sequence.

CI event policy is also intentional: `pull_request` validates proposed branch
commits, while `push` runs only for canonical `main` after integration. Do not
restore unrestricted feature-branch `push` CI alongside `pull_request`; that
runs the same Ruby matrix twice for ordinary PR commits without adding a distinct
gate.

## Tests And Fixtures

- Use RSpec 3 and keep full-suite SimpleCov line coverage at 100%.
- Add regression coverage for every discovered Apple schema or bundle-layout
  variation before changing parser assumptions when practical.
- Keep SQLite databases, plists, image files, and generated bundle layouts
  deterministic and synthetic.
- Keep RuboCop clean and Guard usable for the local feedback loop.
- Target Ruby 3.3 in RuboCop, matching the compatibility floor and designated
  lint/tooling CI job.
- Add a focused regression spec for every bug fix when practical.
- Focused specs may fail the repository-wide coverage gate; the full suite is
  the authoritative coverage signal.

## Source, Documentation, And Compatibility

- Start source files with their repository-relative path prolog. Ruby files put
  `# frozen_string_literal: true` on line 2.
- Keep requires alphabetized within logical groups unless documented load order
  is necessary.
- Require standard libraries in each source file that uses them instead of
  relying on transitive or top-level requires.
- Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and relevant public documentation for public or
  compatibility changes.
- Preserve the MIT license, ownership, backlinks, and documentation footer.

## Git And Release Authority

- `main` is the canonical branch. Work on purpose-named branches and use pull
  requests.
- Never bypass hooks, CI, review, or branch protection.
- Green checks, `bin/package`, and any future release dry run are evidence, not
  authorization to publish.
- Never create or push a release tag, publish or yank a gem, approve a protected
  release environment, or otherwise authorize publication without explicit
  Sheriff approval for that specific release.

## Repository Skills

- `.skills/abbu-format/SKILL.md` for bundle and storage evidence.
- `.skills/ruby-gem-development/SKILL.md` for implementation and compatibility.
- `.skills/testing/SKILL.md` for specs, coverage, and fixtures.
- `.skills/releasing/SKILL.md` for package verification and Sheriff-gated
  publication.
