# Contributing to abbu

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scarver2/abbu
cd abbu
mise exec -- bundle install
```

## DX Loop

```bash
mise exec -- bundle exec guard
```

This runs RSpec and RuboCop automatically on file changes.

## Running Tests

```bash
bin/spec
```

Keep the [format compatibility matrix](FORMAT_COMPATIBILITY.md) passing when
changing parsers, discovery, models or exporters. Add evidence-backed synthetic
variations without replacing legacy fixtures. Run the focused matrix with
`bin/spec spec/abbu/archive_compatibility_spec.rb`; the full suite remains
authoritative for the 100% coverage gate.

## Linting

```bash
bin/lint
mise exec -- bundle exec rubocop -a   # autocorrect
```

## Packaging

```bash
bin/package
```

This builds the current gem, verifies its metadata, installs it into an isolated
gem home, and loads that installed copy. A successful package check is evidence
only; it does not authorize a release tag or RubyGems publication.

Run `bundle install` through the project toolchain first. Package verification
installs ABBU without resolving dependencies again, then loads that installed
copy using Bundler's dependency search paths. Missing runtime dependencies still
fail the load check. Only ABBU is isolated, not the dependency set. The CI Ruby
matrix runs this same command with its Bundler-managed installation paths.

## Pull Request Guidelines

For authorized publication, use the [GitHub-hosted release runbook](RELEASING.md).
It documents exact-commit dispatch, environment approvals, and safe recovery.

- Base branch: `main`
- Commit style: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- All specs must pass and coverage must remain at 100%
- RuboCop must pass with no offenses
- Add an entry to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue on GitHub with a minimal reproduction case.
